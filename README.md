Architecture
During my full stack development project, I worked with two types of frontend development, SPA and Express HTML. Express HTML uses JavaScript to display the pages to the user. By creating routes and controllers, Express HTML can then handle requests from the browser to create the webpage. Angular SPA uses client side rendering, to update the dynamic page without rendering a whole new page. Using components, services, and models, SPA makes the webpage more scalable and efficent. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB because it is scalable and moree efficient. Storing JSON documents allows for managing changing documents with different frameworks like JavaScript and Angular.

Functionality
JSON is a data format that is used by JavaScript to define objects. JSON ties the frontend and backend together by serving as the middle man for data exchange. During the development process, I replaced static HTML with Templates using Handlebars, allowing for the structured page to be reused but refresh the content within the page. Express-Handlebars supports layout and partial templates, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability. Observables were extensively adopted to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, ensuring robust data streams and event-driven behavior.

Testing
Methods are different types of interactions that the client has wioth the server to intereact and create the desired outcome. These methods include, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, all which act as actions for processing data. The API endpoints are used as a form of communication between client and server, using the previous methods. Security in my full stack project consists of authentication of user and password, allowing the user to access endpoints. 

Reflection
I currently work as a Systmes Engineer for the DoD, on the Test and Evaluation team. I am constantly testing software and hardware, so editing and understanding code is crucial to my job. I myself do not usually make the software or the enhancements, but I can fix them when it crosses my path, it is probable that the skills I picked up in this class will shine through my work life. Hopefully creating this project will give me better insight and review tactics for my current job in my workplace. I developed skills in testing and debugging web applications and my skills in HTML and JavaScript have greatly improved, while developing a deeper understanding of TypeScript and Angular.
